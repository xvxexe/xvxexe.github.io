        <h2>who i am</h2>
        <p>
          I am a sixteen years old guy who loves web development in (almost) all
          his shapes and formes. My jurney begins way back in June 2020 (dont
          worry i wont **farlo lungo cerca su google**). My teacher assign us to
          build a website only with HTML... and thats how i got in, a simple
          website only with html, fast forward a couple of months (december
          2020) and i am stuck in the 'tutorial hell'. Eventually i managed to
          get uot if that after 3/4 months and i started to build my portfolio
          in April 2021, but soon i realized that i need some actual projects to
          have a portfolio, so i started building stuff. after several painfull
          days i managed to build a simple weather app in React.js, then a
          recipe app, and then i realized i needed to go over the basics of
          javascript again

        <p>
          I have a costant drive towards web development(**specialmente nella
          parte grafica cerca su google), and honestly i dont exactly know why
          yet. I love technology in general........... what are u trying to
          say??? take a break
